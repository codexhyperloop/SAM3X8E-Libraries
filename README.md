# Atmel-Studio-7-UDOO-Libraries
This repository holds Arduino like functions for the SAM3X8E. The purpose is to allow a user to program the UDOO using Atmel Studio 7 rather than the modified Arduino IDE. Note that the functions are not direct ports of the Arduino source code but rather simplified versions that I find more readable/understandable.
